# Project2 Movie Friends

This site will be a Facebook for movies. You will be able to rate movies and see how your friends rate movies. Although you will see the IMDBRating, the benefit of the site is that you can see how your friends feel about a movie. We all know that our tastes in movies may not always be the same as the general public but, our friends taste is usually similar to ours.
